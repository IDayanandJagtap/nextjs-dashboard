// This folder doesn't affects the route

-   folder created using ()
-   This was done to keep loading.tsx limited to the home(dashboard) page only
-   If it was one directory up then the invoices and customers routes would also have rendered the same loading.tsx
-   But we have used suspense so now there is no use of loading.tsx ... still we have kept the page.tsx here to demonstrate the use of loading page and (anyName) folder
